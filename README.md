# Cyclone Intensity and Track Prediction using Deep Learning
**SERB-Funded Internship at IIIT Kalyani**

🚀 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **predicting cyclone intensity, track, wind speed, and central pressure** using **deep learning models**. Leveraging **INSAT-3D satellite data**, we analyze and forecast cyclone behavior over the **Bay of Bengal** with high accuracy.

📌 **Key Highlights**  
- Processed **80+ GB** of raw satellite data  
- Implemented **CNN-based deep learning models** for prediction  
- Achieved **99.6% accuracy** in central pressure estimation  
- Used **TensorFlow, YOLO, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**

📂 **Current Status**  
Due to the **large dataset size**, file restructuring and uploads are in progress. Stay tuned for updates!
